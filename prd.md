# Product Requirements Document (Fortune 500 Standard)  
## EasyMinutes — *The Fastest Path from Meeting Chaos to Executive-Ready Minutes*

**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**Target:** High-speed, small-team execution  

---

## 1. Product Vision
EasyMinutes eliminates the most dreaded part of meetings — *documenting decisions and next steps* — by producing Fortune-500-standard meeting minutes in under 2 minutes.  

Unlike generic “AI meeting note” tools that focus on live transcription or require heavy integrations, EasyMinutes is the **post-meeting power tool**. Paste chaotic notes, upload files, or drop an audio recording (Pro) — in seconds, you get **executive-ready Action Minutes** you can confidently send to boards, clients, or leadership.

## 2. Competitive Positioning & Differentiation

### Market Problem
Professionals waste 20–30 minutes per meeting formatting minutes, often inconsistently, missing decisions and unclear responsibilities.  
Competitors fall short:  
- Most emphasize *live* transcription, not polished post-meeting deliverables.  
- Many require account setup, integrations, or always-on recording.  
- Output often looks generic — not executive-ready.  

### Differentiators
1. **Zero Friction Start** — no signup required for first use.  
2. **Polish-First Output** — consistent, Fortune 500-style templates.  
3. **Post-Meeting Power** — works with any notes, docs, or audio.  
4. **Personalization Memory (V2)** — adapts to tone, jargon, preferred structure.  
5. **Blazing Speed** — <10 seconds for text inputs, tracked with live countdown.
